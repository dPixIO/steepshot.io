            <span>What is dPix?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                dPix is a blockchain-powered censorship-resistant social platform that you can use to share photos
                with your family and friends. On top of that you can earn crypto rewards for everything you curate, and
                when others engage with your activity!

            <span>How does dPix work?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                dPix is the first photo-sharing dPay powered application. All rewards are generated by the dPay
                blockchain. BEX is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Every day, a fixed reward pool is distributed among
                all users on the dPay blockchain. By upvoting content you can control how much every post should
                receive. Users on dPix will be rewarded with BEX and BBD (BEX dollars) which can be exchanged
                for fiat currencies, reinvested or held on to.

                dSite is one of the social media websites, which pays its users with the digital currency known as
                BEX for posting blogs, commenting and upvoting content.

            <div id="panel-faq">
                To log in you need your dPay account. Go to the wallet on dSite, in the permission section you will

            <div id="panel-faq">
                Adding a profile picture is not supported for now in dPix but you can do that on dSocial. It is a
                bit different from the other social media or blogging platforms. So it may seem hard for new dWeebs.
                <p>Click your circle icon of your account on the top right corner.</p>
                <div><img class="img-faq"  src="{% static 'img/setting1.png' %}"></div>

                The iOS app is ready and available for beta testing. It is closed, but if you want to get access, please
                send your request here: early@dpix.io

        <li name="count-hashtags">
            <span>What number of hashtags is allowed?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                dPix platform allows you to add more than 5 tags. The number of tags is limited to 20. We think
                that this amount is quite enough for almost any user.

        </li>
        <li name="info-waiting-period">
            <span>Why is there a 5 minute waiting period between photos?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                This is a blockchain level restriction in dPay and is very important for dPay, which pays for the
                content. This is necessary to limit spam attacks, cheating money bots, etc. Since we use the dPay
                protocol, we also accept such rules.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-getting-money">
            <span>Why am I getting less and less money on my account?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                Your amount in the tokens (BEX, BBD) remains unchanged if you do not perform any transactions.
                However, BEX/USD conversion rate is highly volatile, so your estimated account balance in USD may
                bounce up & down.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="compress-images">
            <span>Does dPix compress images?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                We don't accept images larger than 10MB, AND if the image is larger than 1MB we automatically compress
                it to be less than 1MB. Any image of size less than 1MB will be stored as is without any modifications.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-get-more-upvotes">
            <span>How to get more upvotes?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                <p>First of all you need to understand, that a great amount of upvotes would not help you to earn a lot
                    of money. It’s because SP influences author payouts, not upvotes count.</p>
                <p>It is better to focus on high-quality content. Try to improve constantly and you will be rewarded
                    sooner or later.</p>
                <p>Another important thing is to use correct tags. Avoid using the most popular ones
                    (dSite, dPay, etc), it only will make your post disappear very fast.</p>
                <p>And don’t forget about the best time to make a post. dPix is being used by a great amount of
                    people from all over the world, it means that they have different time zones. Try to check what
                    time is the most profitable for you.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-power-like">
            <span>What is the Power of Like?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                Each time you press the heart button, you spend a part of your voting power. It is constantly rebelling
                (recharging). The value of each of your likes depends on the Power of Like and your amount of BEX Power combined.
                Do not regret giving your Like Power to someone, but think who is more worthy of it!

                Power of like on the profile page:

            <div id="panel-faq">
                dPix is taking 15% of author rewards for its service.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-copyright-terms">
            <span>What are the copyright terms of dPix?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                <p>dPix is built on top of dPay blockchain and is using IPFS network for decentralized images
                    storage. When you create a post in dPix the unique IPFS hash of your picture is stored in
                    dPay blockchain together with account @username, creation date and other user info.</p>
                <p>This information is publicly available, so you can technically prove to anyone that you are the
                    person who stored this image at this specific timestamp. Copyright is a legal term, so if someone
                    succeeds in connecting the technical proof with the legal world, creating a precedent, dPix
                    becomes a platform where authors are granted exclusive rights for their pictures' use and
                    distribution.</p>

        <li name="dpix-affect-on-dsite">
            <span>Do my actions on dPix affect my bandwidth usage on dPay?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                The bandwidth transactions of your account are on the dPay blockchain. The dPix app generates
                upvote transaction in BEX each time you upvote a post or engage in some way.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-account-value">
            <span>Why does my account value fluctuate so much?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                The value or your account is based on the current value of BEX, BEX Power, and BEX Dollars.
                These fluctuate all the time with market trends, so your account value fluctuates the same way and
                shows you the value in real-time.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-dpix-power-low">
            <span>I'm not able to post, comment, upvote, follow, ..., because my bandwidth (BEX Power) is too low?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                On dPay's network, your bandwidth reflects how many transactions your account is able to generate successfully
                in a fixed period of time. In order to solve this issue you can do two things: increase your bandwidth
                by powering up liquid BEX or just wait some time for the system to let you create transaction further.
